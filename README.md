# Arduino Guide

This site is built with MkDocs and the MaterialX theme.

## Set up

You need Python 3.8 or newer. Next, install the tools:

```bash
pip install mkdocs
pip install mkdocs-materialx
```

## Preview and build

To start a local preview server, run:
```bash
mkdocs serve
```

To build the site for publishing, run:
```bash
mkdocs build
```

MkDocs reads its settings from `mkdocs.yml`, serves Markdown from `docs/`, and writes the generated site to `site/`.
